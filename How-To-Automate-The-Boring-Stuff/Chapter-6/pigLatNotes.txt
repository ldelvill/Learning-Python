Line 17:

You don't get an index out of range error when slicing out of a string's index range.
because your are returning a substring/sequence of that original string, which can be empty.

when you call on a string's index you must return a value that is within range.
i.e. string[0] must return a value vs string[1:0] doesn't need to.
